# LapTimeSimulation
Planar and non-planar lap time simulation including GG diagram generation and track preprocessing.

Future improvements that need to be made:
* Revamping the GG diagram generation code so that instead of solving an OCP problem at each $a_{y}$ point, it solves 1 OCP problem for the entire curve and maximizes some curve "radius".
